# Introduction 

Hello, this is Yao Wang's learning diary. I come from China. And I finished my undergraduate studies at Xi'an University of Architecture and Technology, major in Landscape Architecture. Then last year I came to UCL and studied MArch Urban Design at the Bartlett. Because I am pretty interested in coding and big scale spacial analysis, I applied second Master's degree in CASA, Urban Spacial Science programme.
